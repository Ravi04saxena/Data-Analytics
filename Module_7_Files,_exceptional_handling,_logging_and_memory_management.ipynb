        "\n",
        "#### Purposes of the logging Module -\n",
        "1. Debugging Code -\n",
        "   * Helps you trace how your program is running step-by-step.\n",
        "   * More flexible and informative than using print().\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Recording Errors -\n",
        "   * Logs warnings, errors, and exceptions that happen during execution.\n",
        "   * Critical for identifying what went wrong and where.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Saving Logs to Files -\n",
        "   * You can configure logs to be saved in a file for later review — especially useful in production.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Controlling Log Levels -\n",
        "   *  Allows filtering logs by severity - DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Customizing Output Format =\n",
        "   * Add timestamps, log levels, module names, etc., to your logs.\n",
        "   * Example - logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Circular References -\n",
        "   * Python uses reference counting + garbage collection.\n",
        "   * Circular references (e.g. two objects referring to each other) can’t be cleaned by reference counting alone.\n",
        "   *  The gc module helps detect and clean them, but manual intervention may be needed in complex cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Memory Leaks -\n",
        "   * Python can still suffer from memory leaks, especially when:\n",
        "     * Unused objects are still referenced.\n",
        "     * Large objects are cached unintentionally.\n",
        "   * Common culprits: global variables, large data structures, open file handles not closed properly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) -\n",
        "   * The GIL prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecode in parallel.\n",
        "   * Makes multithreaded programs CPU-bound rather than memory-efficient.\n",
        "   * Can lead to inefficient memory usage in threaded programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. High Memory Overhead -\n",
        "   * Python objects (like lists, dictionaries) use more memory than equivalent C structures.\n",
        "   * Built-in types have extra metadata, which adds overhead.\n",
        "   * For large-scale or memory-sensitive systems, this can become a performance bottleneck.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Unpredictable Garbage Collection -\n",
        "   * Python's garbage collector runs automatically at intervals.\n",
        "   * You don't control exactly when memory is freed, which might be a problem in real-time systems.\n",
        "   * Manual collection (gc.collect()) can help, but is rarely ideal.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. External Libraries/Extensions -\n",
        "   * C extensions or bindings (like NumPy, TensorFlow) may manage their own memory.\n",
        "   * If these libraries leak memory or hold references unnecessarily, Python's GC won't catch it.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Best Practices to Handle These:\n",
        "  * Use del to delete large unused variables.\n",
        "  * Use gc.collect() only when necessary.\n",
        "  * Monitor memory with tools like tracemalloc, objgraph, or memory_profiler.\n",
        "  * Prefer generators over lists for large data.\n",
        "  * Close files and connections with with blocks.\n",
